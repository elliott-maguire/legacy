# legacy

Hi! My name's Elliott Maguire, but if you're here, you probably already know that. At the time of this writing, I've been programming for several years, professionally for almost 3. I've written a whole lot of code in that time, and grown/learned a whole lot, and I decided to, rather than having my GitHub repositories a mess of old projects and such, I would make a central repository for my old and retired projects.

Keep in mind that these are **old** and **retired**. There's a lot of bad and incomplete code in here, and none of this is really meant to be run, so good luck if you try. Also - this repository does not contain anything that I've worked on recently or am actively working on.

Also, this isn't all of my old work. A lot has been lost, deleted, etc. so I wasn't able to include probably 25 - 30% of my previous works.

Enjoy! It's pretty funny when you get to the older stuff...
